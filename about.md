This is a blog where I, Tina, write about the stuffs I want to. It can be about anything.

Since I'm a young IT student using my free time to play [Japanese rhythm games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatmania_IIDX) and code random stuffs, this blog is mostly about programming and Japanese games.

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and love &hearts;.
