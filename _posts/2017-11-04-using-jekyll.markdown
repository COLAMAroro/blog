So I wanted to finish up a working blog and faced my usual dilemma : I did not want to use a CMS (like *Wordpress* or *Blogger*) and developing one myself took a lot of time. It took a lot of time because I can't juste write an interface to a database that fetches and puts articles inside. No. I want something fast and secure.
